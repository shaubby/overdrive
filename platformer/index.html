                    <p>sprites are the images of your game. they represent your platforms, backgrounds, and your orpheus.</p>
                    <p>to make a sprite, right click on the <span>Sprites</span> folder in the <span>Asset Browser</span> on the left. Then, click <span>Create Sprite</span> and call it <span>sPlayer</span>. </p>
                    <p>(you can call it whatever you want, but i promise this naming scheme makes things super easy) </p>

                    <p>notice that each of these sprites are 16x16 pixels. generally, pixel art is done on a grid, where each sprite is either 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels. this makes everything look neat and super easy to work with.</p>

y_speed = 0; <br/>

                    <p>this code creates four different variables which we will use for heidi's movement: horizontal speed, vertical speed, gravity, and movement_speed</p>
                    <p>the <span>Create</span> event only runs when an object is created, so x and y speeds start off at 0 since heidi is initially still</p>

                    <p>next, add this code so that heidi can move left and right when the arrow keys are pressed:</p>
                    <pre class="code">
if keyboard_check(vk_right) { <span class="green">// if the right arrow key is pressed</span><br/>

                    <p>finally, add this code at the end of the <span>Step</span> event to update heidi's position based on her speed. </p>

                    <p>im sure you noticed that heidi fell straight through the floor, so lets fix that!</p>
                    <p>first create a new object called <span>oSolid</span>, this will function as a parent object for all of our solid objects that heidi can collide with</p>
                    <p>then, go to <span>Parent</span> and add <span>oPlatform</span> as a child object</p>

                <div class="full-column">
                    <p>now go back to the <span>Step</span> event in <span>oPlayer</span> and add this code to let her jump and collide with platforms:</p>
                    <pre class="code">
if (place_meeting(x, y + 1, oSolid)) { <span class="green">// if heidi is on the ground</span><br/>
    if (keyboard_check_pressed(vk_up)) { <span class="green">// and the up arrow key is pressed</span><br/>
        y_speed = -10; <span class="green">// make heidi jump by setting her y_speed to a negative value</span><br/>
    } else { <span class="green">// otherwise, if heidi is on the ground but not jumping</span><br/>
        y_speed = 0; <span class="green">// set her y_speed to 0 so she doesn't fall through the ground</span><br/>
    }<br/>
}</pre>
                    <p>next change this code:</p>
                    <pre class="code">
x += x_speed; <br/>
y += y_speed;</pre>
                    <p>to this:</p>
                    <pre class="code">
move_and_collide(x_speed, y_speed, oSolid);</pre>
                    <p>move_and_collide automatically handles collisions for us, so heidi won't fall through the ground anymore!</p>
                    <p>also, place_meeting checks if the current object (<span>oPlayer</span>) occupies the same space as another object (<span>oSolid</span>). we use y + 1 so we can check if heidi will collide with oSolid if she falls any further.</p>
                    <p>now, you can try out your game! the movement will still feel a little bit weird, so mess with the jump speed, gravity, and movement speed to get it feeling right!</p>

                    <p class="header">polishing up</p>
                    <p>we're almost done, lets just finish up a few more things</p>
                    <p>first, we should make the spikes kill the player, add this code the the player <span>Step</span> event:</p>
                    <pre class="code">
if (place_meeting(x, y, oSpikes)) { <span class="green">// if heidi collides with the spikes</span><br/>
    room_restart() <span class="green">// restart the level</span><br/>
}</pre>
                    <p>let's also restart the level when the player goes out of bounds</p>
                    <pre class="code">
if (y > room_height or y < 0 or x > room_width or x < 0</0>) {<span class="green"> // if the player is outside of the room</span><br/>
    room_restart(); <br/>
}</pre>

                    <p>also, lets make heidi face the direction she's going by adding these lines:</p>
                    <pre class="code">
if keyboard_check(vk_right) {<br/>
    x_speed = movement_speed; <br/>
    <span>image_xscale = -1;</span> <span class="green">// flip heidi's sprite so she faces right</span><br/>
} else if keyboard_check(vk_left) {<br/>
    x_speed = -movement_speed; <br/>
    <span>image_xscale = 1;</span> <span class="green">// reset her sprite so she faces left</span><br/>
}</pre>
                    <p>you'll realize that heidi flips directions really weirdly, this is because her center isn't properly configured.</p>
                    <p>go to the sprit <span>sPlayer</span> and change the center to <span>Bottom Centre</span></p>

                    <p>now what to do next? take some time and turn this template into a cool little game, add your own art and mechanics and make it your own! here are some ideas:</p>
                    <p> - replace the art and add a background! heidi jump is cool, but everyone who uses this guide makes it, so you should use your own or find some art (16x16 or something else) on itch.io</p>
                    <p> - make the level bigger, change the room size, make the camera follow the player, there's so many possibilities!</p>
                    <p> - add some more levels and a win screen, we didn't do anything with the tree for a reason, it's for you to decide what happens when heidi reaches the tree</p>
                    <p> - add some cool mechanics, double jumps, collectables, its entirely up to you!</p>
                    <p> i didn't teach you how to do these things, but there are lots of guides and tutorials online to help you out!</p>
                    <p>happy coding!</p>
