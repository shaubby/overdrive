                    <p>first, make sure to install gamemaker and create a blank project: <a target="_blank" href="https://gamemaker.io/en/download">https://gamemaker.io/en/download</a> </p>
                    <p>also, download my assets here: :insert link to asset pack: </p>

                    <p class="header">sprites</p>
                    <p>sprites are the images of your game. they represent your platforms, backgrounds, and your orpheus.</p>
                    <p>to make a sprite, right click on the <span>Sprites</span> folder and click <span>Create Sprite</span> and call it <span>sPlayer</span>. </p>
                    <p>(you can call it whatever you want, but i promise this naming scheme makes things super easy) </p>
                    <p>now, you can import your sprite! normally you should make your own sprite but i made one for you this time. you can just hit <span>Import</span> and select the player sprite from my asset pack: :link: </p>
                    <p>notice that each of these sprites are 16x16 pixels. generally, pixel art is done on a grid, where each sprite is either 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels. this makes everything look neat and super easy to work with.</p>

                    <p>lets make some <span>objects</span> now!</p>
                    <p>sprites are the images of your game: by themself they can’t really do much, but you can attach them to objects to make some really cool things. </p>
                    <p>right click on the <span>Objects</span> folder and click <span>Create -> Object</span>. call it <span>oPlayer</span> and assign the <span>sPlayer</span> sprite to it. here, you can create <span>Events</span> to add code your objects, but we can wait and deal with that later. </p>
                    <p>now, go back and do it again for the flag, platforms and spikes! make sure to import the sprites and attach them to objects.</p>                </div>
